Though trained since birth to be a loyal and obedient soldier, FN-2187's conscience conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a time he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping to escape the galactic conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As the galaxy became consumed by war, the renegade trooper was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay. ",
    "Rey": "Rey Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human female who, after years of living as a scavenger, became a Jedi during the war between the First Order and the Resistance. Unaware of her lineage as the granddaughter of Emperor Sheev Palpatine, Rey was the only name she went by prior to assuming the Skywalker surname. Rey ultimately chose the Jedi path, despite inheriting her strength in the Force from a Dark Lord of the Sith. She also formed a unique bond with Supreme Leader Kylo Ren. Notwithstanding their adversarial relationship, Rey and Ren were the realization of a prophesied dyad in the Force. ",
    "Poe Dameron": "Poe Dameron was a human male who originally served as a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, before becoming a pilot in the New Republic and eventually joining the Resistance, rising to become acting General of the Resistance, during its conflict and subsequent war with the First Order. The son of Lieutenant Shara Bey and Sergeant Kes Dameron of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot, serving the New Republic Defense Fleet as the commander of Rapier Squadron, but grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the Galactic Concordance. Dameron defected to the Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing starfighter, Black One. ",
    "BB8": "BB-8, sometimes spelled and pronounced Beebee-Ate and nicknamed BB, was a BB-series astromech droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. It had a dome head, similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8 was mostly white, with some silver and orange on its body, as well as a black photoreceptor. The droid belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-wing starfighter. ",
    "Captain Phasma": "Phasma was a human female stormtrooper captain of the First Order. Phasma grew up as a member of the Scyre clan on the nuclear-ravaged world of Parnassos. She was a formidable warrior who became the clan's military leader. Seeking passage offworld, Phasma helped the First Order General Brendol Hux find his ship in the process betraying her own brother Keldo and clan. After being rescued, Phasma joined the First Order, abandoning her former life on Parnassos. ",

PLANETDESCRIPTION = {
    "Tatooine": "Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld to the influential Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history. Part of a binary star system, the planet was oppressed by scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had no natural surface vegetation.",
    "Alderaan": "Alderaan, located in the Core Worlds, was a terrestrial planet covered with mountains. During the waning decades of the Galactic Republic, it was ruled by Queen Breha Organa and represented in the Galactic Senate by her husband, Senator Bail Organa. ",
    "Yavin IV": "Yavin 4 was the jungle-covered fourth moon in orbit around the red gas giant Yavin. Prior to and during the Galactic Civil War, it hosted the headquarters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a group of resistance fighters that opposed the dominant Galactic Empire. Following a major battle that took place around Yavin, the Alliance relocated its headquarters to Hoth.",
    "Hoth": "Hoth was a remote, icy planet that was the sixth planet in the star system of the same name. It notably hosted Echo Base, the temporary headquarters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, until the Galactic Empire located the Rebels, initiating a major confrontation known as the Battle of Hoth. ",
    "Dagobah": "Dagobah was a planet in the Dagobah system, and one of the purest places in the galaxy within the Force. A remote world of swamps and forests, it served as a refuge for Jedi Grand Master Yoda during his exile after the destruction of the Jedi Order. Luke Skywalker received advanced training in the ways of the Force under Jedi Master Yoda on Dagobah, and it was later the place of Yoda's death and transformation into the Force. ",
    "Bespin": "Bespin was an immense gas giant located in the vicinity of the Anoat system, a desolate sector of the galaxy. Bespin had several moons, and its gaseous mass contained a thin stratum of habitable atmosphere. Its layers were a source of rare Tibanna gas, which was harvested and refined in several mining complexes, including Cloud City, an opulent metropolis suspended in the planet's huge billowing clouds. The Ugnaught city of Ugnorgrad also was located over the planet, being ruled by King Ozz in the time after the Battle of Endor. During the Galactic Civil War, Bespin remained unaffiliated, but that did not prevent the Galactic Empire from garrisoning the planet and seizing Cloud City. However, with the Empire's defeat at Endor, the gas giant and its prosperous mining colony ended up recovering their freedom.",
    "Endor": "Endor, designated IX3244-A, also known as the Forest Moon of Endor or the Sanctuary Moon, was a small forested moon that orbited the Outer Rim planet of the same name and was the homeworld of the sentient Dulok, Ewok, and Yuzzum species, as well as the semi-sentient Gorax and Wistie races. ",

They were commonly encountered throughout the galaxy, from the bountiful planet of Naboo to the desert world of Tatooine. They were known to engage in many different pursuits, from politics to bounty hunting. Species that bore structural resemblance to humans were referred to as humanoids.",

The most notable member of this species was the warrior Chewbacca, Han Solo's best friend and co-pilot, who played a vital role in the Clone Wars during the defense of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Civil War by aiding the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, and the war against the First Order. They were quite strong, and were known to rip people's arms out of their sockets when provoked.

A number of Rodians acted as bounty hunters, including Greedo and Jakoli. Greedo was an amateur eventually killed by the smuggler Han Solo, while Jakoli was a skilled bounty hunter who only killed his targets. Some Rodians also worked as informants, such as Tsoklo, who worked for the Galactic Empire. ",

Trandoshans relished the thrill of a hunt, and were known to embark on a hunting related rite of passage. Garnac was a Trandoshan hunter who operated a game preserve on the moon Wasskah, and oversaw his son's fatally failed rite of passage, which was done in the form of hunting a Jedi Padawan.

    "Ewoks were individuals that stood about one meter tall. They used spears, slings, and knives as weapons; they also used hang gliders as vehicles. Although skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology, the Ewoks had yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered by the Empire. They were quick learners, however, when exposed to advanced technology with simple mechanical processes and concepts.",

Slingshots were extremely popular with Xexto, since their multiple sets of limbs made the weapons convenient to use. Gasgano, a famed Podracer pilot, was a Xexto, as was the pickpocket and pawn shop owner Ferpil Wallaway. A Xexto known as Sister Six worked as an assassin during the Galactic Civil War, while Captain Perrili of the bulk freighter Romary was a smuggler and Resistance contact. ",

",
    "Skakoan": "Skakoans were a sentient species of amphibians native to the planet Skako.

Unlike Twi'leks, a Togruta's lekku ran parallel to the head as opposed to behind, making it appear as though they were wearing a headdress. Togruta were also distinguished by montrals, large hollow horn-like projections from the top of their heads, that gave the species a form of passive echolocation. In order to protect themselves from dangerous predators, and to hunt their own prey, Togruta banded together in tribes and relied on their natural pigmentation to disrupt and confuse slow-witted beasts. Togruta worked well in large groups, and individualism was seen as abnormal within their culture, although it was also a necessary quality in leaders. ",
    "Kaleesh": "Kaleesh were reptilian humanoids from the planet Kalee.

    "Pau'an": "Pau'ans were gaunt near-Humans native to the planet Utapau. Also known as Utapauns and Ancients due to their long lifespans, they co-existed on Utapau with the Utai. The two species got along well, with the lanky Pau'ans assuming leadership roles on the planet. Though some viewed the Pau'ans as frightening, they were friendly, and were more than happy to welcome visitors to their little-known world. Due to Utapau's remoteness in the Outer Rim Territories, the Pau'ans were isolated for most of their history. However, they played a part in galactic events in 19 BBY, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Utapau. The Pau'ans opposed the Confederacy with the aid of the Republic, and later opposed the Empire, after Imperials took control of their planet following the Declaration of a New Order. ",
